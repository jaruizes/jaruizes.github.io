This is my first post.  

I'm so excited because I'm moving from [my old blog](http://www.jaruiz.es) in Wordpress to this blog using Jekyll.  

Besides that, I'm going to write every post in English although the final idea is building a multi-language site but I have to study how to get this with Jekyll. For this reason (my English), I would like to say sorry in advance.  

This blog has to be a good exercise to improve my English and broadcast everything what maybe I know a little and I think it could be useful or interesting for other people.  

I'll try to select the best posts from my old blog and posting them here.     
   
Thank you!
